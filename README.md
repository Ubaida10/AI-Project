# Health Sound Analysis Using Mel Spectrograms

This project, developed by [Your Name] and [Friend's Name], uses machine learning and audio processing techniques to analyze heart and lung sounds, aiding in the detection of potential health issues. By converting sound recordings into Mel spectrograms and using a neural network model trained on specific medical conditions, this project identifies patterns associated with various diseases, providing a non-invasive approach to preliminary health diagnostics.

## Overview

The **Health Sound Analysis Using Mel Spectrograms** project processes heart and lung audio recordings and classifies them to detect potential health issues. The model was trained on a labeled dataset that includes audio samples of different diseases, enabling it to recognize specific sound patterns associated with each condition.

## Project Objective

This project aims to:
- Enable early detection of heart and lung diseases through sound analysis.
- Provide a preliminary diagnostic tool for health professionals and researchers.
- Explore the potential of Mel spectrograms in medical applications.

## Features

- **Heart and Lung Sound Analysis**: Processes and classifies heart and lung sounds, distinguishing between healthy and diseased conditions.
- **Disease Classification**: Uses machine learning to identify diseases based on sound patterns from a labeled dataset.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Provides insights on detected health issues for preliminary analysis.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implements a deep learning model for high-accuracy classification of health sounds.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains heart and lung audio recordings, each labeled with a specific disease condition. The data is openly available, and the link can be accessed here: [Dataset Link](insert-link-here). This dataset includes:
- **Heart Sound Samples**: Normal and abnormal heartbeats, murmurs, etc.
- **Lung Sound Samples**: Normal breathing sounds and abnormal sounds (e.g., wheezes, crackles) indicating respiratory conditions.
